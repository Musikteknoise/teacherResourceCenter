               <p><strong>Student Drop Notifications</strong> – The Attendance page will now notify you of students who drop from your classes.  It will give you information like when and where the student went, including the other teacher or period if the student transferred.  This feature must be enabled by your system administrator.</p>
 
                   <p><strong>Attendance Notes</strong> – The Attendance page can now allow teachers to view and add Attendance Notes into the system.  This feature must be enabled by your System Administrator.</p>
 
                       <p><strong>New Grade Levels</strong> – Aeries now supports "TK" and "PS" Grade Levels.  If you teach these grade levels, your students will now be shown with the correct grade level description.  Also, Aeries now supports creating specific standards-based report cards for the TK and PS grade levels.  <a href= "http://www.aeries.com/blog/ps-tk-support-define-student-grade-levels" target="_blank">Read More </a></p>

                               <p><strong>Gradebook Has a New Look</strong> – Over the last year many schools and teachers have been transitioning to the new look of the Aeries Gradebook.

We want you to get to where you want to go quickly.</p>
 
                   <p><strong>Parent Portal</strong> – Did you know our parent portal supports 6 different languages: English, Spanish, Vietnamese, Chinese, Korean, and Arabic.  We are continuing to add more translations in these languages throughout the parent portal.</p>

            <h4><a name="scholarship"></a>Michael A. Schenck Scholarship</h4>
        <p>Aeries is proud to offer our first student scholarship. Many clients have inspired us over the years that have contributed to their communities and districts. One of those inspirations came out of Konocti School District, an Aeries client for years. Michael A. Schenck was the Technology Director and his recent passing has only fueled our passion to give back to the communities we serve.  Michael was known personally by our staff and is remembered for his passion for technology, environment, family and student success. So to commemorate his life and passion for technology we created this scholarship and are honored to use Michael as our inspiration. The first annual award will only be available to Konocti USD students that are in the 2016 or 2017 graduating class.

          <p>Ken O'Connor, is a consultant who specializes in issues related to the communication of student achievement, especially through consistent, accurate, meaningful, feedback supportive of learning, grading and reporting.</p>
     
          <p>In 1995, Ken developed eight guidelines for grading, and he has continued to refine those guidelines. In 2007, the same ideas were organized into fifteen fixes for broken grades.
